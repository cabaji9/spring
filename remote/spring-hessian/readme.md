## HESSIAN

## RUN


This starts Jetty and serves up your project on http://localhost:8080/.

Jetty will continue to run until you stop it. While it runs it periodically scans for changes to your project files If you save changes and recompile your class files, Jetty redeploys your webapp, and you can instantly test the changes that were just made.



```
mvn jetty:run
```
